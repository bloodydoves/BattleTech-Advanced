# Don't Shoot The Dead

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Mechs won't waste heat or ammo on already killed targets  while in melee.

## Gameplay changes
- Attacking Mechs won't shoot their short range weapons if the target already died from the melee attack
- Additionally the delay between a melee attack and the following weapons fire (if applicable) is significantly reduced
