It was the silent star of 'The K Team' a Canopian serial from the 3010s about a small mercenary company travelling the Periphery and helping locals against rogue Great House units and, sometimes, pirates. As such the mech is based on holovid logic where jump jets for a dramatic entrance are absolutely mandatory, switching to direct fire LRMs is tactical brilliance and running low on rifle ammo adds tension. Armor and cooling are more of an afterthought with basic 10 heat sinks and Light Plating Armor to save on costs. In the years since the show ended its run a number of Periphery commands have replicated the K-T variant because 'it works in the holovids' with varying results.",
