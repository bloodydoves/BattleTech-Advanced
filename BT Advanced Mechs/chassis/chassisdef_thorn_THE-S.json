		"Details": "The Thorn is a light BattleMech which was originally intended to operate as a scout but was too slow for true scout work. Eventually it was rebuilt in 2549 to serve as a light support platform thanks to the first-ever use of Endo-Steel and CASE on a mech. Supplied by ComStar to the Draconis Combine as part of Operation Rosebud in 3035, the THE-S was a downgraded factory refit of the THE-N. Stripping out the advanced Endo Steel chassis and CASE, the use of a heavier standard chassis forced a reduction in the Thorns armor protection by half a ton, most of which was removed from the head and rear torso.",
