It used a Light Fusion Engine to push the 'Mech up to speeds of 118.8 km/h and was capable of reaching speeds of 151.2 km/h through the use of a MASC system. The 'Mech could also jump up to two hundred and ten meters. An additional weight saving measure on this variant was the use of a Small Cockpit. The 'Mech was armed with two Light Machine Guns for anti-infantry and crowd control use. To defend itself against 'Mechs and vehicles, the 6S had a single ER Medium Laser.",
