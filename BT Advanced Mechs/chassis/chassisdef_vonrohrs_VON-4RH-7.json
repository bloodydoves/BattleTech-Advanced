After being revived by the FRR as an insult to House Kurita, the FRR quickly found itself in need of an upgraded variant of the Von Rohrs for its military. The VON-4RH-7 was the result, armed with the upgraded technology of the Star League that was rediscovered by the Helm Core. An XL 325 Engine provides power and speed, while 13 DHS keep it cold. For firepower, the VON-4RH-7 mounts an ER PPC and LRM-20 at range with a Medium Laser and pair of Flamers backing it up at close range. The VON-4RH-7 went on to serve with moderate distinction in the KungsArme, at least before that military's decimation by the Clans.",
