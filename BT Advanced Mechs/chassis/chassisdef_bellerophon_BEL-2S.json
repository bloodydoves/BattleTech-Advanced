Thanks to almost six centuries of improved BattleMech knowledge, Lyran designers rapidly sorted out the issues with the original design and even changed around the design slightly. The SRM was swapped for a heavier LRM-15, made possible by use of a standard engine and armor. The Large Lasers were retained but a new set of 16 heat sinks kept the mech well cooled. The Bellerophon served well and went on to have several later upgrades as technology recovered.",
