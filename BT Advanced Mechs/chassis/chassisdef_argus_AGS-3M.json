However, the designers were given a little too much latitude with the rest of the mech's systems and after a few greased palms the -3M was put into service. The backup weapons for the Magshots turned out to be a pair of Thunderbolt-10 launchers and a solitary ER Large Laser. While the missiles proved effective, supply issues often meant the -3M was immediately refit upon reaching the front lines.",
