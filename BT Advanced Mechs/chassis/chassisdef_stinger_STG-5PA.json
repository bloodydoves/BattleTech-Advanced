		"Details": "A decidedly interesting modification to the Stinger 3G, the 5PA is a Periphery Arms testbed in a new series of light 'Mech hunters. Greatly up-engined due to the use of a prototype XL180, it can keep pace with anything on the field. Armor is stripped and replaced with PAI's Light Plating system, weighing in a full ton over the standard 3G's. As far as weaponry, the 3PA switches out the two Medium Lasers for two Small Lasers, welded together in the right arm. The company needed a way to capitalize on light 'Mech weaknesses (low armor), and remove their strengths (speed/maneuverability). The solution for this model was characteristically low-tech, a pair of industrial chem Sprayers mounted into the arms containing cryogenic solution and corrosive liquid. To complement its main mission and increase its viability as a general recon 'Mech, PAI's smoke designator system was mounted into the center torso.",
