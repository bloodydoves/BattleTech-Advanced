Without the delicate XL engine, the -7J could no longer carry its massive Gauss Rifles, instead carrying a pair of AC/10s. The remaining weaponry was downgraded, as well as the heat sinks being replaced with the weaker standard versions of the day. The two things that stayed the same however was the mech's ponderous speed and tremendous armor capability.",
