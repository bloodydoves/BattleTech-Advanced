Eventually it was rebuilt in 2549 to serve as a light support platform thanks to the first-ever use of Endo-Steel and CASE on a mech. The Thorn carries a weapons array that is not usually seen on light 'Mechs: a LRM-5 launcher mounted in the right arm with one ton of reloads in the right torso, paired with two Medium Lasers split between the head and left arm. This lets it outclass most mechs of its size in combat.",
