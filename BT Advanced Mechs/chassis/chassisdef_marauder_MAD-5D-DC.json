A direct upgrade of the 3D model, the -5D-DC's engine was replaced with a XL Engine. The -5D-DC's primary weapons were two ER PPCs, supported by a Large Pulse Laser. The medium lasers were replaced with two Medium Pulse Lasers, while a Small Pulse Laser was added to the center torso. The -5D-DC also mounts a command console for maximum battlefield coordination. The model was protected by fourteen tons of armor and carried sixteen double heat sinks for heat management. It also had a jumping capability of up to 120 meters thanks to four jump jets mounted in its legs.",
