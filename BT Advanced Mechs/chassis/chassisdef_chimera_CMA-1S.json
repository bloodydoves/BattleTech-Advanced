		"Details": "Similar to the earlier Gunslinger, the Chimera was designed in the spirit of cooperation between the Combine and the Federated Commonwealth in the lead-up to Operations Bulldog and Serpent. Eventually, the design was co-oped by Archon Katherine Steiner in the lead up to the FedCom Civil War, but thanks to Theodore Kurita Chimeras still made their way to pro-Victor units. The Chimera is built on an Endo Steel chassis that carries a 240 XL engine and the Chimera's mobility is enhanced by six jump jets. The Chimera carries an eclectic mix of weapons. The 'Mech has, as its primary weapons, an ER Large Laser and a MRM-20 launcher. For close combat, the Chimera is armed with a ER Medium Laser and a Machine Gun.",
