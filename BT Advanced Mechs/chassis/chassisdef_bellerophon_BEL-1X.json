		"Details": "Though it never made it to full production due to issues with the design, scholars consider this. the Bellerophon, the second true BattleMech. Designed by House Steiner shortly after their acquisition of the Mackie, the Bellerophon had technical issues with its gyro that prevented full-scale deployment and was lost to history. However, it was revived in the 3060s both in the Lyran Alliance and in various Periphery states that needed any hardware they could get. The Large Lasers and SRM-4 combo quickly overwhelm the spare 14 heat sinks, but the armor is acceptable and the speed is ok, leading to its deployment in Periphery armies.",
