The small production runs for the design ensured that while it remained a popular unit, it was never very numerous and suffered once Blue Shot's factory was destroyed during the Succession Wars. The variant known as the -8Q is a stopgap model created during the Succession Wars to keep damaged Lynxes functioning. It uses a standard engine and heat sinks, which necessitated the removal of the torso mounted Medium Lasers. The ER PPC was also downgraded to a standard Large Laser, resulting in the -8Q having a pair of Large Lasers and a pair of Medium Lasers.",
