The Yeoman has an awkward physical appearance when compared to most other BattleMechs as it is dominated by its massive missile ports. The Yeoman is powered by a 240 fusion engine that gives the Yeoman a top speed of 64.8 km/h. To save weight, the 'Mech has an Endo Steel chassis and is armored with eight and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor that provides a respectable amount of armor protection. The Yeoman carries two LRM-15 launchers and LRM-10 launchers. Since that is the only armament on the 'Mech, any MechWarrior that pilots a Yeoman has to be wary of letting enemies get close, as it has no secondary weapons to deal with such foes.",
