The engine was exchanged for a extralight model and carried fourteen double heat sinks. The normal PPC was replaced by a ER PPC and the LRM launcher had been upgraded to a LRM-20 launcher for more indirect fire support capabilities. Finally a Small Laser was mounted in the left torso and the two tons of LRM reloads in the left torso were protected by CASE.",
