Compared to the original it replaced the standard fusion engine with an XL Engine and completely re-armed the 'Mech with recovered Star League-era weapons. The primary weapons were two Large Pulse Lasers, backed up by two Medium Pulse Lasers. Finally, in place of the Autocannon/5, the 5M carried a LB-X Autocannon/10. The 5M had a jumping distance of up to one hundred and twenty meters thanks to four jump jets mounted in the legs and carried sixteen double heat sinks. One ton of ammunition for the LB-X was carried in the left torso and protected by CASE.",
