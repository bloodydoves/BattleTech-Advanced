Given the mech's poor reputation, it was a favored target during the civil war for the SLDF. Those that survived the war were left to ComStar's supplies, where they fared poorly at Tukayyid. Eventually, the Jackrabbit found its way into the Word of Blake Militia, as well as the Rim Collection's burgeoning military. The JKR-9R, also dubbed the Joker, swapped the -8T's AC/2 for a Large Laser, a heat sink, and another ton of armor, making it far superior to the original.",
