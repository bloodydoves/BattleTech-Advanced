But the engineers at PAI weren't satisfied with just that, they realized that with 6 light rifles, comes great unreliability and decided the next best thing to do was to slap as much armour on that 'Mech that they possibly could. Supplementing a Core 300 fusion engine with their primitive XL upgrade allowed them enough weight savings to weld on a makeshift shield on the left arm and loads of heavy metal plating to reinforce the otherwise measly hull.",
