Armed with the new Light Autocannon/5, a quartet of them in fact, and a Light PPC, the MLN-2B quickly proved its worth in a skirmish with Combine forces on the Outworlds planet of Alegro. Though it was less of a trooper and more of a ranged fire-support design, the Outworlds leadership was pleased and put the mech into wide production despite its advanced Endo-Steel construction.",
