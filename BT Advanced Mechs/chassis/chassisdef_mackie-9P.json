		"Details": "The Mackie MSK-9P saw its first production in the Taurian Concordat as a cheap Assault mech for other minor powers that, through its immense single attack power, could overhwhelm any other assault mech it encountered with one single salvo. Using the barest minimum of 'modern' technology, the 9P uses paired PPC's in place of the AC/20 found in the original 9H, maintaining the damage at the cost of higher heat. The left arm is replaced by a huge rocket launcher that originally saw its turret designed for use on tanks but was redesigned to fit the mackies side torso. The centre torso features two machine guns added under slung to the Medium Lasers to allow the pilot the barest chance against modern infantry. In order to make the most of what minor powers had, the Mackie MSK-9P is clad in a heavy coating of Heavy Plating Armor to boost its defence, with a cheap and easy to maintain Fuel Cell engine occupying the remaining weight.",
