		"Details": "The Fireball was a quick response BattleMech built as a direct result of the Clans' Elemental infantry. The result was a 'Mech which on paper met many of the criteria for successfully dealing with Elementals but in reality was woefully inadequate for the job. The 9D is a compromise between the 7D and 8D models. Released at the same time as the 8D, this variant removes the machine gun and its ammunition and replaces them with a single medium laser. The 'Mech retains its Streak launcher, but gains an additional half ton of armor protection.",
