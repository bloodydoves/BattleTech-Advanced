The finished product, while not as powerful as the OmniMech it emulates, is a powerful 'Mech with an undeserved bad reputation. The Rakshasa is powered by a 375 XL engine and built on an Endo Steel chassis to save weight and allow the 'Mech to carry as similar a weapons payload as possible to the Mad Cat. The Rakshasa also carries eleven and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor giving it slightly less than maximum armor protection. The Rakshasa carries a pair of LRM-10 launchers. These are mated to an Artemis IV fire control system. The LRM launchers are backed up by a pair of two Medium Lasers and a Medium Pulse Laser. The 1B variant of the 'Mech is a modification made to make the 'Mechs heat levels more manageable. The two ER Large Lasers have been replaced with standard Large Lasers sacrificing range for heat efficiency.",
