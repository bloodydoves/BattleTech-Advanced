		"Details": "The Wraith marked Curtiss Militech's entry into BattleMech production. When the design was announced, many felt that the design would be little more than a walking water cooler. What the critics got was a shock. It is built around a massive LTV 385 XL Engine that allows it to reach speeds of just under 119 kph. The 'Mech is also fitted with seven CurtissJet 55 jump jets which allow it to jump up to two hundred and ten meters. The Wraith has a simple, yet effective, weapons payload. The 'Mech is armed with an ER PPC that provides the majority of its firepower. Backing this up is a pair of Medium Pulse Lasers that provide firepower for close-in work.",
