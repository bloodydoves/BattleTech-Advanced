		"Details": "The first homegrown BattleMech produced by the Draconis Combine was the Gladiator and it was a dismal failure. However, nationalistic pride demanded the restoration of the Gladiator's honor and the design came back into service in the 3050s as the Combine recovered from the Clan Invasion. The GLD-4K was the first of the upgraded versions and saw a basic Star League tech upgrade. Built on the same reliable 275-rated engine as the original, the -4K was armed with an ER PPC, a Streak SRM-2, and twin Medium Lasers for no-frills firepower. 5 jump jets kept it mobile while 15 standard heat sinks managed the heat acceptably. The design, while not quite popular, did serve ably with various Combine regiments.",
