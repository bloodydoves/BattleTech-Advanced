Taking advantage of the sheer rate the 30-ton Valkyrie was produced in, Marian agents would start offering open bounties for any chassis no matter how wrecked. These damaged frames would be shipped back to Horatius where Marian Arms Incorporated Mech Techs would coat it's structure in a Proto-Endosteel sheath in a process similar to electroplating and clad the Mech in Light Plating Armor. In order to best put down rioting civilians, the VLK-2H's main weapon was a Marian-produced Medium Revolving Rifle fed by two tons of ammo, backed up by a pair of Rocket Launcher 15s one of which would often be loaded with Inferno Warheads to ensure any dissidents learn their lesson.",
