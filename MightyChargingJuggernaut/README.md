# MightyChargingJuggernaut

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Juggernauts can CHARGE into other mechs at sprint range and gain GUARDED state after making regular melee attacks.

## Gameplay changes
- Juggernauts can CHARGE into other mechs (and ONLY mechs) at sprint range.
	- This will be handled like a sprint regarding instability reduction (none)
	- It will cause additonal stability damage to the target
	- Movement to target will not decelerate at the end
	- It will ALWAYS use the "Charge" melee animation
- Juggernauts gain GUARDED state after making regular melee attacks.
	- Instability reduction from standing/walking is applied
	- Instability reduction from bracing is supressed
- AI Juggernauts seems to make use of it too (needs final confirmation)
	- Beware of "Brawler Banshees"!

## Known issues
- As Guarded incorporates Entrenched at the moment (hardcoded via "GuardLevel") Juggernauts also get ENTRENCHED when brawling.
	- This is probably too strong but seems to be inevitable right now
