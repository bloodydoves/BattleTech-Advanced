The Trooper is a popular scout mech in the Sanctuary thanks to its high speed and small profile. The most pure scout from among the Sanctuary Trooper variants, the -3S exists to go as fast as possible and little else. Powered by a ridiculously fast 200-rated XL fusion engine and equipped with an Active Probe, the -3S has barely any firepower to speak of, only a brace of 4 Machine Guns. Still, the speed is immense, making it a trade worth taking.",
