However, the Sanctuary Worlds did not forget the Trooper and in fact iterated on it as their recon mech of choice. The Trooper is a popular scout mech in the Sanctuary thanks to its high speed and small profile. The TP-2D is a support chassis, designed to cover for allies and provide some protection for scouting lances. With its AMS and ECM Suite it can cover its allies easily. However, this comes at the cost of offense, as only a pair of DRM-2s and Small Electro-Lasers provide any offensive grit.",
