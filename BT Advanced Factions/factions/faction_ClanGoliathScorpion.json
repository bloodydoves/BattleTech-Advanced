		"Freeborn, my Clan has faced you in battle before, and you are a competent warrior. Take up this batchall and perhaps we can find a more common purpose.",
		"Freeborn, you are an unknown to us. Prove yourself on the field of battle with this batchall and we may have further use of you.",
		"Freeborn, you have assisted the Goliath Scorpions in the past, and so I will offer you this batchall so that we can continue this relationship.",
		"Hello again, friend to the Goliath Scorpions. While there is certainly trust between us, I would like you to take this batchall to show your sincerity before we share all our secrets with you.",
		"Greetings friend. You have proven your value to the Goliath Scorpions many times. I have a task I would entrust to no other, and perhaps afterwards we shall share some necrosa?"

	"Description": "Clan Goliath Scorpion is obsessed with recovering any and all lost artifacts of the fallen Star League, sending Goliath Scorpion Seekers, fueled by ritualistic necrosa visions, far and wide to recover them, leading to Goliath Scorpions showing up in the most unlikely of places. After having been exiled from the Clan Homeworlds, the Goliath Scorpions have settled in the Deep Periphery in Nueva Castile.",
