I will travel with an appropriate bodyguard, but otherwise, I need to go alone. Lady Gallas was rightâ€”we've lost too much already. I won't see the army move on Guldraâ€¦ not if I can do the job myself.*  :

Guldra is a core system, a veritable fortressâ€¦ if we attempt an invasion, there will be terrible losses on both sides. I won't allow thatâ€”not if I can achieve our goal another way. And I am confident that I can accomplish through subterfuge what our army could not: the recovery of the evidence we need, <i>without</i> unnecessary bloodshed.* ":
