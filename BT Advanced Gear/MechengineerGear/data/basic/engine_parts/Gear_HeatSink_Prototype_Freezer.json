		"Details": "These heat sinks, nicknamed the Freezer Heat Sink, are a Late Succession Wars experiment to create the old Star League-era Double Heat Sinks. Almost identical to the Star League version, the Freezer has two major things that make it different. First, the Freezer actually had better overall performance than the Star League Double Heat Sink, thanks to some creative engineering. Second, and much more importantly, they could not be engine-mounted and required being mounted alongside Standard Heat Sinks exclusively, due to engineering limitations. Freezers were generally considered a limited technology and were eventually set aside in favor of true Double Heat Sinks with the discovery of the Helm Memory Core.",
