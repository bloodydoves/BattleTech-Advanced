		"Details": "The Ambassador was made with the best technology the Star League could invent in order to ensure that the diplomatic figure driving the 'Mech was as protected and comfortable as possible. Among the technology invented for the Ambassador was this armor plating. Designed to perfectly protect the Ambassador against all harm, this armor effectively quadruples the Ambassador's protection at the cost of moderate bulk. Because of the armor's specific properties and being designed specifically for the Ambassador, it cannot be removed or replaced.",
