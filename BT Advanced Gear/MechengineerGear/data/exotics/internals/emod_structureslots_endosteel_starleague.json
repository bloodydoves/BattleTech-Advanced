		"Details": "The Ambassador was made with the best technology the Star League could invent in order to ensure that the diplomatic figure driving the 'Mech was as protected and comfortable as possible. Among the technology invented for the Ambassador was this structure material. While the Star League did have standard Endo-Steel, it was deemed insufficient for a design of the Ambassador's quality so the Star League iterated on the material and developed an even lighter material that saved even more weight than its progenitor. However, this advanced Endo-Steel was incredibly expensive to produce and install so it never saw deployment on anything except the Ambassador.",
