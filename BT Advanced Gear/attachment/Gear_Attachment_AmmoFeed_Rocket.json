		"Details": "Rocket Launchers, outside of the Marian Hegemony, have never featured as a prominent weapon system in most militaries. Their one use nature precludes extended firefights. However, the ever-questing minds of Periphery Arms, Inc. decided to solve that particular conundrum with a low-tech but functional ammunition feed, geared to accept MRM ammunition. The Rocket Ammo Feed still doesn't make Rockets particularly durable weapons, but they have a little extra oomph now.",
