The most successful variant leading up to the HLH-1 was eventually known as the HLH-P (P for Prototype). While the HLH-1 and HLH-2 became the primary variants, the HLH-P was successful enough that Clan Nova Cat kept it as a potential field refit kit. Armed with the same LB-10X Autocannon as the later HLH-1, the HLH-P swaps the rest of the firepower for a SRM-6 and twin ER Large Lasers. To pay for the heavier lasers, it uses a slower 250-rated XL Engine as well as the standard Endo-Steel and Ferro-Fibrous.",
