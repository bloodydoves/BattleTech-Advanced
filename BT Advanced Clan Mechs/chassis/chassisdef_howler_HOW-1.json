		"Details": "Originally conceived as a totem mech for Clan Fire Mandrill, the Howler was first seen in the Inner Sphere as a part of Jade Falcon second-line forces. With a high ground speed of 119 kph and packing a powerful punch for its size of triple LRM-5s, the Howler is surprisingly potent for a 20-ton mech. The high speed and heavy armament is made possible by Clan weight saving technologies such as Endo-Steel structure and Ferro-Fibrous armor. The Howler also has deep ammo bins for its size, meaning it makes a great mech for training new MechWarriors.",
