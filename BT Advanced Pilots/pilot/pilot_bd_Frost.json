        "Details": "Scorch lost a father and brother to Kuritan abuse while they worked for Swedenborg Heavy Industries. He grew up fighting for stronger worker protections, and did a stint in the KungsArme as an infantryman. When he got out we went to work for a merc company, and when it fell apart he took his Cataphract as back-pay. He's always happy to fight Kuritans, and offers a discount when it comes to protecting unions or poll workers. He supports the Motpart's goal of aligning to the FC and is active in the Modern Norse faith. He wears his bias against Kurita - and sometimes anything oriental - on his sleeves.\r\n\r\n <b><color=#099ff2>SPECIAL AFFINITY WITH CATAPHRACTS</color></b>\r\n\r\n <b><color=#099ff2>CHECK PASSIVE ABILITIES IN COMBAT FOR A UNIQUE SURPRISE</color></b>",
