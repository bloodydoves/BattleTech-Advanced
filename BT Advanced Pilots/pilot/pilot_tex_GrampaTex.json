Even in the Inner Sphere, where age is less of an impediment for mechwarriors due to advanced medical procedures and prosthetics, Grampa is very old to be a pilot. He didn't age gracefully either, often going off on random tangents and falling down a lot. Still, when you get him on-topic (and on-target) he proves to still be a crack shot in the cockpit. But you still have to deal with him on comms, which might not be worth it. Your call, Commander.\r\n\r\n <b><color=#099ff2>CHECK PASSIVE ABILITIES IN COMBAT FOR A UNIQUE SURPRISE</color></b>",
