        "Details": "Born to an unremarkable Steiner-allied military family, Markus was quickly inducted into war academies from a young age, rising through the lesser officer ranks at a comfortable rate. A naive optimism lead him to a belief in the invincibility of the Lyran military, so often the downfall of an overconfident Lyran commander.\r\n\r\nThis tidy, ordered outlook on life was quickly shattered during the assault on Coventry by Clan Jade Falcon in 3058. When the Coventry Military Academy was attacked and swiftly overwhelmed, Markus was forced to go to ground along with his fellow cadets, but found himself and his unit isolated and alone. Carrying out the last orders he was given, Markus began his own guerilla operations to hamper the occupying Jade falcon forces however he could.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was a series of ineffective raids that lead Markus to develop his preferred mech-fighting tactics: Swift and silent stalking followed by a sudden furious assault, before slinking back into the shadows like the ancient deepsea predators of Terra. Hence the callsign.\r\n\r\nNot without his own scars, Markus watched as his young but determined lance members died first-hand, one after the other, to the hands of the 2nd Falcon Jaegers. A grim realisation that being a Lyran officer meant nothing in the face of a deadly enemy, Markus developed a grudge against Jade Falcon that likely won't soon pass.\r\n\r\nWhen the reinforcements arrived on Coventry, Markus had already gone to ground so deeply, recovery was impossible and he was presumed KIA. In reality, he'd decided to use the chaos of the invasion to desert the hubristic and cocksure Lyran military, bitter at the false sense of superiority that had been engendered on him.\r\n\r\nCarcharodon now prefers the employ of fearless mercenary commanders operating near the borders of Jade Falcon space, and willingly plies his agressive battleskills to any who pay well, and ask few questions of his past.",
