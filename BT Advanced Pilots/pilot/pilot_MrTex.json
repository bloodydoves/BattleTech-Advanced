In typical mercenary fashion he is rough around the edges, but reliable when he gets paid. \r\n\r\nA professor of Inner Sphere history with a strong dislike of Clanner society. A veteran of many campaigns, he has demonstrated how to survive to payday. \r\n\r\nHe gives guest lectures wherever he goes, and has caused political incidents for Mercenary Groups he's been working for with them.",
