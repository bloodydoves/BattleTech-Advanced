It retained the same energy weapons as the original 3N but replaced the standard autocannons with Imperator Ultra models; though the ammunition load remained a single ton, it was moved to the right torso and protected by CASE. Twelve double heat sinks were mounted and another ton of armor was carried. The free weight for all these changes was created by the use of an 240 XL Engine. One thing which wasn't replace however were the comms and targeting systems.",
