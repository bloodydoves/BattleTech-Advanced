He joined the Lyran Military, attended Coventry Military Academy and rapidly became a Lieutnant. However, sometime during the Clan Invasion he left service with his Mech, and became a Merc. His shot is a bit rusty, and his reaction time isnt as fast as it was in training, but his mind is sharp as a knife still.",
