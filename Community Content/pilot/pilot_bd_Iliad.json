Evidently the world you found him on.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't take much prodding for his explanation either. He is all too eager to explain that he is the reincarnation of Hercules and that fighting amongst the dreggs of the inner sphere and beyond as a Lancer-for-hire is one of his many 'Labours'.\r\n\r\nYou assume, like many others would, that he's crazy. Seeing him pilot his 'mech however would quickly dissuade you from passing up on hiring him.",
