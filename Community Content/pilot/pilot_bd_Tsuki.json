		"Details": "Born into a warrior family on Bichester in the Draconis Combine, Ash was always watching in awe as his siblings were drilled in the ways of Mech-to-Mech Combat. He would talk endlessly with his brothers and sisters, cousins and friends to learn all he could about the topic that fascinated him so deeply. His parents, desiring their son to follow in the footsteps of the generations before him, highly encouraged this behavior. He was enlisted into military academies, boot camps, anything that a young boy was allowed to join in order to gain the Honor his family so desired, That was, until the Clans invaded.\r\n\r\n Ash watched as slowly, more and more of his family were called to fight for the honor of the Dragon, to repulse these invaders from beyond the sphere. He watched, again, as less and less returned home. By the time of Tukayyid, Ash was 18. He had seen his oldest brother changed entirely by the war, no longer wishing to even look at or speak to him. His elder sisters never returned, rumored to have been killed in the forests of Port Arthur by the Nova Cats. Much the same could be said for countless cousins, never to be seen again on their homeworld. These losses were absolutely devastating for his family, who now forbid Ash from ever seeing the frontlines, for fear of losing him too. Ash, however, could not be swayed.\r\n\r\n Hatred and Revenge against those that took his loved ones away boiled inside of him, driving him to enlist with the DCMS. A short tour of duty later, and the young man was now disillusioned with fighting for the Pillar of Steel. He saw the Inadequacies of the DCMS as willful ignorance, and chose to leave. Gathering every penny he had, and travelling far beyond the reaches of Kurita; he soon took on the callsign 'Azalea' when fighting in the rings of Hardcore, an homage to his eldest sister. Though his love for the Combine, and even his new home of Canopus, still shines bright; it's obvious that the man has been consumed by his desire: To end the clans, once and for all.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
