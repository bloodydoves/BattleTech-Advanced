        "Details": "Theo's piloting skills have been the butt of jokes since his days at the Academy. His mech's gait is often described as \"shambolic\" or \"drunken stumbling.\"  But Theo doesn't care.  Give him a mech with lots of armor and firepower and he goes straight up the middle, drawing fire from the rest of the lance while moving steadily forward.\r\n\r\nSure, he's gotten much better at piloting over the years but that's because he realized it's easier to drive into an enemy mech than avoid it.",
