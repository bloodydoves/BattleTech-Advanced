The plans for the Enfield were lost during the Succession Wars and were recovered by the Federated Suns, finally seeing production in the 3050s. This variant, the END-6Z, proved a little too expensive for wide use but was still deployed in small numbers. Armed with only a Rotary AC/5 and a Large X-Pulse Laser, it may have few weapons but they are hard-hitting.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
