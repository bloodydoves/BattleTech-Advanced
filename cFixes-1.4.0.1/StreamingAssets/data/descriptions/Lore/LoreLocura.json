The code's original purpose is unclear, but it appears to be at least tangentially related to the SLDF's Space Defense System program.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Murad inadvertently unleashed the Locura on the <i>Argo</i>'s main computer, it wreaked havoc across the ship, bringing down the ship's main drive and damaging a variety of shipboard systems. She eventually managed to quarantine the Locura on the <i>Argo</i>'s secondary storage drive, which she then separated from the rest of the ship.",
