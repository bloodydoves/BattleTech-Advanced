		"Details": "An extremely unusual variant of the Thorn, the THE-H was created to make use of recently developed technologies and to prove they had value even on the lightest of units. Clad in Ferro-Vanadium armor and powered by a heavy but highly effective Dense Engine, the -H is effective, fast, and durable. However, those benefits come at a cost and the -H has very little tonnage left for weapons after nearly maxing the armor. With only a measly three Medium Electro-Lasers to its name, the -H is only so effective in combat and often is ignored until easier targets are defeated.",
