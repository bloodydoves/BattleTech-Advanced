Though it, like its cousin the Ostroc, was unpopular it remained in service for most of the Sanctuary Worlds history. The OWR-3F is an Ostwar variant produced expressely for the Taurian invasion and is built for manueverability and independent operation. Built on a 325-rated XL Engine and equipped with 5 Jump Jets, the -3F is unusually fast for its size. For firepower, it has an all-energy loadout of two NPCs and four Twin-Linked Small Lasers. A brace of Heat Controllers help keep the heat manageable while Endo-Steel and Ferro-Fibrous provide the needed weight.",
