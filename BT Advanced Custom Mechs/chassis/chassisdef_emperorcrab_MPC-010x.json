Using a completely redesigned chassis, the MPC-010x may as well be a different mech entirely at this point. Built on a 300-rated Light Fusion Engine, the Emperor Crab carries a weapon loadout reminescent of the KGC-010 on which it was based: a pair of Snub-Nose PPCs and a pair of SRM-6s occupy the torsos while a gigantic pair of Rotary Autocannon/5s take up the arms. 18.5 tons of armor and 16 double heat sinks keep the mech going. The Emperor Crab has been criticized as taking design cues from the Supernova Clan mech, though Cosara point out that the Supernova is based on the King Crab, so they're all King Crabs effectively.",
