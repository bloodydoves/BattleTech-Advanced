The chassis was salvaged, and used as a testbed for new and cost-saving technologies. It had been built with Endo Steel for weight savings, so a spare 210 XLFE was added to both increase ground speed and maximize space for test systems. A cutting-edge Thunderbolt 10 launcher, supplied with two tons of ammo, was chosen as its primary weapon. An MRM10 was mounted on the ‘Mech’s left arm, and twin Rocket Launcher 10s were subbed in where the torso SRM2s would normally go, presumably to test their viability as cheaper last-ditch, holdout, or firepower enhancement systems.",
