		"Details": "Gauss rifles generally fire machined precise slugs of ferrous metal at high velocity, but they don't <b>have</b> to. Instead, a gauss rifle is quite capable of firing basically any ferrous metal you can cram into the barrel and famously have been known to fire building girders and even stripped parts of downed mechs. This ammo box is such an ammo, just crude slapped together bits of whatever would work. It is cheap to replenish, but it does less damage and is less accurate than a properly machined gauss slug. <b><color=#099ff2>Does not explode.</color></b> Has 6 shots.",
