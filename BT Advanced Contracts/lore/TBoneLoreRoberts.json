    "Details" : "Your contact with the Band of the Damned pirate gang, D.P. Roberts is certainly a character. Not much is known about him, except that he is a capable MechWarrior, and his manner of speaking appears to be adopted wholesale from an obscure ancient Terran media series depicting historical events during the Age of Sail. No one knows what D.P. stands for.",
