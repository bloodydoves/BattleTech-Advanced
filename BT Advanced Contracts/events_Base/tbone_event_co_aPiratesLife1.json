But you and yours, what with bein' all \"registered\" and \"licensed\" and \"whatnot\" with the veneer civilization an' legitimatism, could do. If'n yer interested, give us a nod or a wink an' we'll surely keep you apprised when choice chances do occur. Mind, if'n we come to ye with a job, ye best be takin' it or we'll find some other outfit fit for the task.\r\n\r\n-[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreRoberts],D.P. Roberts]]</i></b>\r\n\r\n\"Darius? Mind translating? Their speech-to-text software must <i>hate</i> them...no one actually writes like that, do they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Commander, I <i>think</i> what they're saying is that they'll contact us with special jobs if we agree, but they'll be upset if they bring us a contract and we <i>don't</i> take it.\"",
