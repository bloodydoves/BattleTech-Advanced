	"Details": "Regardless of the era or location, there are always those who want to move goods (or people) from one place to another without paying taxes, coping with government interference, or even just for discretion's sake. Smugglers are experts at moving their cargo under the noses of bureaucrats, soldiers and pirates who might want the items for themselves.\r\n\r\nSmugglers possess a blend of social charm, and incredible piloting ability, relying on the latter when their deceptions fall through. In war times, smugglers can be found working for all sides with some havomg a 'No Questions Asked' policy regarding the goods they transport, while others are more particular about what they'll carry in their cargo holds and might not transport certain items such as drugs, weapons, or people bound for slavery.\r\n\r\nPASSIVE: The Commander gains 10% sensor range.",
