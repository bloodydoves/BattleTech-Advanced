	Since the beginning of the 31st century, the situation in the [[DM.Factions[faction_Outworld],Outworlds Alliance]] has become particularly grim. With the general loss of technology, Alliance worlds have suffered from declining population and literacy levels. Though protected by a strong military, many of these planets are unable to feed their own people. The people feel that their government has betrayed them, and there have been many riots and demonstrations against the hereditary regimes in recent years.",
