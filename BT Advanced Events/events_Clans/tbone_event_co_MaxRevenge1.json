You know I lost most of my family when the [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanWolf],Wolves]] invaded in '52 and wiped out my town? So there I was, reading my datastream mess hall, and up pops the Star Commander and the unit that led the attack. They're right here down on the planet, and I intend to issue a [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreBatchall],<i>batchall</i>]]. It's the only thing I can do to avenge my father and brother.\" \r\n\r\nHe continues with a pained look in his eyes: \"Now Doc says I mangled my trigger finger clenching the knife. I didn't even realize I was holding it. Last I spoke to my mother, she was worried for me; thinks I'm consumed by vengeance. I'm not stupid, I get that I'm in bad shape, but I can't let this go either. Commander, will you take this fight for me?\"",
