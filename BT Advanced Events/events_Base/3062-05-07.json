        "Details": "MARIK-LIAO MARRIAGE CALLED OFF!\r\n\n\nSian, Capellan Confederation: Chancellor Sun-Tzu Liao has officially announced the end of his engagement to Isis Marik. Sources close to the chancellor claim that “cultural differences” and “political expediency” are behind the decision. No other details have been forthcoming, but several detachments of the CCAF along the border of the Free Worlds League are reportedly being maintained in a heightened state of readiness.\r\n\n\n\nNERVE AGENTS USED IN ST. IVES CONFLICT!\r\n\n\nSt. Ives, St. Ives Compact: In what is becoming known as the Black May attacks, a series of nerve  gas attacks by rogue elements of the Capellan Confederation has left the leadership of the St. Ives Compact reeling but unbroken. Sources within both the Compact and the Confederation indicate that the attacks are being carried out by a splinter sect of “Thuggee cultists” loyal to Kali Liao, sister of Capellan Chancellor Sun-Tzu Liao. These same sources indicate that Kali Liao has since been remanded into the custody of the Star League Council to stand before  a war crimes tribunal in Atreus. Retaliatory nerve attacks are likely to continue.\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",

                        "Details": "A spokesperson from the Capellan Confederation Armed Forces has confirmed that the nerve agent being used in the Black May attacks was also responsible for wiping out the MAC 1st Regiment battalion on Wei in late 3060. The same spokesperson was authorized to confirm that enhanced interrogation of captured Thuggee terrorists suggests that up to fifteen canisters of nerve agent are yet unaccounted for, with the potential to cause over 5 million casualties. Although the specific formulation of the nerve agent has not been released, previous conflicts on Wei had resulted in the release of a Star League-era agent designated UrbStryc-A, and mercenary commands deploying to either the vicinity of Wei or the St. Ives Compact are encouraged to take all necessary precautions, including preparation of NBC-MOPP and DeCon gear where applicable.",
