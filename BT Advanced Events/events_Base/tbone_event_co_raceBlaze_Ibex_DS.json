Apparently we've arrived in the system just in time for a race, and {SCN_MW.SUBJ} needs to know whether to sign up:\r\n\r\n<i></b>Commander, if we're going to do this race, there are a few things you need to know. This one takes place in the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[BiomeDesert],desert]], so we have a few options. I can push hard and drive aggressively, but we're gonna want to keep an eye on the heat gauge. In addition, this is a 500km route, so fuel might be a concern. On the other hand, I can play it a bit safer and hope to make up the time in the straightaways. Like most of these races, there's also an optional \"shortcut\" route; looks like it runs through a crystal field, but that shouldn't make a difference for us. Just let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll get things ready to go. Of course if we don't have time, I understand.</i></b>",
