Any trouble shutting it down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not, Commander. What I wrote was nothing like the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLocura],<b>Locura</b>]].

Contrary to improving morale, it mostly seems to have the traditionally superstitious MechWarriors a bit unsettled. Unfortunately, lax discipline also means things in the MechBay aren't running as smoothly. You hope Darius gets back to his old self soon, or you may need to have a talk with him. He really does seem a little bigger than before...",
