Publicly accusing Katherine of ordering the assassination of their younger brother Arthur, Victor has maintained that Katherine is unfit for rule over the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFedCom],Federated Commonwealth]] and must be removed at any cost. For her part, Katherine has denied any involvement in Arthur’s death, and has accused Victor of simple jealousy and ambition.\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",
