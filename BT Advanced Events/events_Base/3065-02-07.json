In the Isle of Skye, long a troublesome province in the Lyran Alliance, what were once the mere grumblings of a discontented populace are becoming the louder calls for independence. The so-called “Free Skye” movement has been further emboldened by the words of Duke Robert Kelswa-Steiner after his marriage to Hermione Aten, Duchess of Skye. Although ostensibly loyal to Katherine Steiner, Duke Kelswa-Steiner has publicly stated his displeasure at “the free people of Skye being used as pawns in the squabbles of Great Houses,” and the possibility of open revolt looms.",

The two halves of the sundered Federated Commonwealth would do well to take advantage of this development.",
