I heard from a friend who's local right now and he's got something he's gotta off-load ASAP. His stable won a fight recently and got this weird thing they're calling the Ettin as a prize. Problem is, the stablemaster <i>hates</i> FrankenMechs and is demanding they get rid of it immediately. He knew I was in town and let me know. For a pretty low price we can score a premium one-of-a-kind FrakenMech here! Whatta ya say, do I call him back?\"",
