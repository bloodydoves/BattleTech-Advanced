Darius worries if [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] will remain loyal to {COMPANY.CompanyName}.\r\n\r\n\"I graduated with a huge debt of around \u00A241,000. The Hero Training Institute has sold our loans to a private company which has caused the interest rate to skyrocket. At no point was I consulted about this and of course I would never have agreed to this enormous increase in fees.\r\n\r\nFrom the attached image you will see the sum of my student loan is currently standing at \u00A2183.568, with the fees raking up over \u00A27.000 monthly.\r\n\r\nJust to cover the interest, I would need to be earning much more than any employed MechWarrior makes. Unless I earn that much, my student loan will increase due to the interest. This is a predatory business model, and it is a stain upon the Institute.\r\n\r\nI hereby ask you to reconsider these practices, and allow me to pay off my debt in full 10 years after graduation, just as was part of the initial arrangement. I would like to request permission to extend this timeframe for the inflated debt.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\nAlumni [[SCN_MW,Griggori Izzo]]\"",
