Cognizant of the shared heritage of his command, Lt. Gen. Andrew Giggins was loath to declare for either Katherine or Victor, preferring to maintain neutrality. However, neutrality is one of the first casualties in a civil war, and last March Giggins declared the Fourth would support Victor Steiner-Davion’s bid to unseat his sister. While some have blamed Katherine’s announcement that neutral units constitute an unacceptable security risk for forcing Giggins’ hand, the General has thus far kept his council close. Whatever the reason, the Loyalist Second Donegal  Guards arrived on Giausar to arrest or destroy the Fourth just over a week later. Though outclassed by the Guards, the Lancers have used their superior maneuverability to avoid a decisive engagement. However, Giausar is a vital trading hub, and the slow tempo of combat operations here cannot continue forever. As the FedCom Civil War heats up, expect the low simmer on Giausar to become a rolling boil.",
