Where the original Gunslinger Program was formed with the goal of improving SLDF mechwarrior training to match that of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] duelists, the reinstated Gunslinger Program is specifically designed to give Inner Sphere personnel an edge when fighting Clanners. The FWC Gunslinger Program is open to the citizens of all [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague2],Star League]] member states and promises to give enrollees the advanced tactical training needed to take on Clan warriors in one-on-one duels.",

Although technically restricted to [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFedCom],Federated Commonwealth]] forces, it is likely only a matter of time before this technology finds its way across the Inner Sphere.",
