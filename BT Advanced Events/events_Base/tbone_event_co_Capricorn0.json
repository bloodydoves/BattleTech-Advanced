This program is designed to give new OMTC recruits immediate hands-on experience in an active MRBC-registered Mercenary Command, under the mentorship of a veteran mercenary. In exchange for your services, the OMTC will provide lump payments at level 3 and level 5 [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreMCC],MechWarrior Core Competencies]]. The recruit is considered to have completed their Field Experience Enhanced Training once any further MCC has reached level 6, at which point the the recruit will return to Outreach and you will receive further remuneration. If you are still interested, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nParnabus E. Jackson\r\n\nCoordinator, FEET Program\r\n\nOutreach Mercenary Training Command</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\"See, Commander? You took me on when I was just a wet-behind-the-ears rookie, but I know I was lucky. Not everyone gets that chance. I figure this is a way of helping the next set of aspiring mercs, and it could be good for our bottom line <i>and</i> our reputation. What do you think?\"",
