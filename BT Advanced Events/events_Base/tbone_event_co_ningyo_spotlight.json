I've been reading about these rare silicon dioxide crystals that are supposed to be able to shrink tumors on their own, but they're kind of expensive. What do you think?\"\r\n\r\nYou consider a moment before asking \"Doc, what kind of surgery we talking about here? Is this crystal option real?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's brain surgery, Commander.
