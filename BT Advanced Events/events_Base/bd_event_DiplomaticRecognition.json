The [[DM.Factions[faction_WordOfBlake],Word of Blake]] logo on your viewscreen fades, indicating the connection has been made, and a gently smiling Blakist [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LorePrecentor],Precentor]] takes the logo's place. The robed figure greets you warmly. \"Thank you for speaking with me, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}. The [[DM.Factions[faction_WordOfBlake],Word of Blake]] has taken notice of your mercenary company's many excellent works throughout the Inner Sphere and wishes to recognize you formally as a friend of interstellar relations. To that end, we are prepared to send you a hand-built [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAmbassadorClass],Ambassador]]-class BattleMech, straight out of the First [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague],Star League]]'s archives here on Terra. In return, we only ask that you continue your good works and that you consider continuing to spread the word of Holy Blake as you have done. What say you?\" You'd heard rumors that the fabled Ambassadors were being put back into production by [[DM.Factions[faction_ComStar],ComStar]] and later the [[DM.Factions[faction_WordOfBlake],Word of Blake]] but you never dreamed that you'd somehow acquire one. You ask if there's any strings attached. \"None, Commander, this is a recognition of your excellent [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],MRBC]] rating and your willingness to further the cause of international relations. The Word stands ready to deliver your BattleMech immediately, you only need give the word.\""",
