        "Details": "Originally from Brisbane in the Taurian Concordat, Florence grew up in a beach house a little out of the way from the tourists.  She worked in the small stores nearby, eventually going from manning the till to actually making the goods in the bakery. \r\n\r\nWhen the Brisbane Virus spread to her area, she saw the community crumbling around her.  Terrified of the planet, and of the nervous twitches she developed, she boarded the first charter, applying for passage as a cook.  Seeking treatment for nerve damage, she practiced with a medbay Neurohelmet, initially for diagnostics, later because it was empowering.  Caught clocking extra hours in a repair bay mech by a commander in a good mood, she was given the choice to resign or impress him. Natural talent for piloting allowed her to change her apron for a mechsuit. \r\n\r\nShe's not so fond of beaches anymore, but you can still find her enjoying a swim, preferably in a Low-G Pool.",
