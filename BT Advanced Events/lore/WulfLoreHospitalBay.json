    "Details" : "The original <i>Argo</i> specifications had room and infrastructure for actual hospital facilities, rather than just simple Med Bays. With a full hospital's worth of equipment and connections to the ship's library and databases, the MedTechs are able to perform near-miracles of healing. All Med Bays will be converted into Hospital Bays.",
