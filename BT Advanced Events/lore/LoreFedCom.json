    "Details" : "Born of Archon Katrina Steiner's \"Peace Proposal\" to the Great Houses, the Federated Commonwealth came into being with the conclusion of the Fourth Succession War, and the union of the former Lyran Commonwealth and the Federated Suns. In 3057, Katherine Steiner-Davion seceded the Lyran half of the Federated Commonwealth, creating the Lyran Alliance and effectively ending the existence of the Commonwealth as a unified nation, although the Federated Suns half continues to refer to itself as the Federated Commonwealth.",
