    "Details" : "The Magistracy Armed Forces (MAF) is the military arm of the Magistracy of Canopus. The Magistracy has traditionally regarded its armed forces as a necessary evil, providing it with fewer resources than other states and largely reserving it for defensive purposes against pirates and invaders. However, closer ties between the Magistracy, Taurian Concordat, and Capellan Confederation are increasing the size and sophistication of the MAF.",
