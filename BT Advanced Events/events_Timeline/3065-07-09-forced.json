[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRDF],Regional Defense Forces]] 1, 3, and 4 have all converged on Bremen in prior weeks and fortified the world as much as was possible to do. To face them, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMagonScott],Khan Magon Scott]] has brought all of his available forces: Alpha, Hellion, Tau, and Seeker Galaxies are all dedicated to the attack. Khan Scott has even created an ad-hoc galaxy from garrison forces, Grunt Galaxy, and ordered them to the attack on Bremen as well.",
