The Alliance units are making no efforts to conceal their presence nor are they looking to seize control over the area. In fact, in an unusual move, their units seem to be uncoordinated and acting somewhat erratically, attacking targets seemingly at random and simply burning and destroying as they go. The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreACM],Aurigan Coalition Military]] has been scrambled and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKameaArano],High Lady Kamea Arano]] has issued a call for peace with the Sanctuary Alliance.",

It has issued orders to the rogue units to stand down lest they face termination at the hands of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreACM],ACM]]. [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKameaArano],High Lady Arano]] has accepted the Alliance's assurances and has directed the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreACM],ACM]] to destroy the rogue units forthwith.
