Under the command of <i>Sho-sho</i> Laura Nelson, the Second Genyosha and Sixteenth [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGaledonRegulars],Galedon Regulars]] landed on Marduk on the 2nd of June and began their assault. Simultaneously assaulting the Victory facilities and the city of New Pontiac, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] units were quickly heavily engaged by the First Chisholm's Raiders occupying the planet. Within New Pontiac, Combine forces were assisted by remnants of the Twenty-second Benjamin Regulars as well as armed civilians, effectively surrounding and isolating the Raiders. With the bulk of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] forces assaulting the Victory plant, losses quickly piled up on both sides. Although Sandoval's units held defensible positions, a sizable portion of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] force consisted of special forces contingents specially drilled in recapturing heavily defended industrial targets. Despite inflicting heavy casualties on the Combine forces, within a week over half of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreVictoryIndustries],Victory Industries]] facilities were under Combine control. By the 20th of June, General Neece saw the writing on the wall and on the 22nd the battered Raiders withdrew.\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",

With the Combine-Dominion treaty in effect, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTedKurita],Theodore Kurita]] was finally able to re-task the Ryuken-Go, the Twelfth [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGaledonRegulars],Galedon Regulars]], and the remnants of the Seventh Ghost Regiment to liberate the world from Hauptment General Kev Evans and the Seventeenth Hussars. General Evans' forces had been unable to completely pacify the planet, and with the arrival of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] task force under the command of <i>Tai-sa</i> Davis Shotoku, the invaders quickly found themselves fighting guerrilla forces while trying to redeploy to meet the oncoming threat. Despite the guerilla distraction, General Evans has thus far managed to successfully counter the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] aerospace superiority and blunt Shotaku's assault. With the initial liberation stalled, both Shotaku and Evans appear to be settling in for a long campaign.",
