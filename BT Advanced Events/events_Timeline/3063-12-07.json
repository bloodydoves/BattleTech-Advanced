Although occasional skirmishes between the Clanners are common, the raids have reportedly captured the attention of Dominion command, and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] commanders have observed some limited redeployments of Dominion units. With elements of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSandoval],Duke Sandoval]]'s Draconis March wreaking havoc in their backyard, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] commanders are sure to take advantage of the respite, however brief.\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",
