The Clan's forces are digging in on their most recently conquered worlds while the Hanseatic League prepares counterattacks. Meanwhile, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMagonScott],Khan Magon Scott]] has directed several galaxies to attack from an unusual angle, striking the mostly unprepared worlds of Braunschweig, Tomalov, and Lübeck. Truly, the Scorpions appear to be intent on taking the entire League at once, a premise the Hansa are virulently opposed to. Meanwhile, the League has launched a counter-attack against Köningsberg. Reports indicate that the counterattack is being met by Alpha Galaxy under the command of Khan Scott himself.",
