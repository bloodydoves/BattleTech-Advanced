Facing the full force of the Falcon touman, the Wolves were unable to hold several of their conquest, even losing a handful of their own worlds to [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMarthePryde],Marthe Pryde]]'s counterattacks. By late June, both Khans were forced to acknowledge that continued combat operations would open their respective flanks to depredation by other clans operating within the Inner Sphere. By the time the cease-fire was formalized, [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanWolf],Clan Wolf]] had claimed Seiduts, Quarell, Steelton, and Zoetermeer, while the Falcon's had pushed deep into the Wolf Occupation Zone, taking Bessarabia, Biota, Cusset, and Domain. \r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",
