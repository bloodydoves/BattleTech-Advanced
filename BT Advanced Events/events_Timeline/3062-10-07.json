Negotiations laying the groundwork for the nonaggression pact had been ongoing since the late 3050's, and both Taurian and Canopian forces have seen action in the ongoing Capellan-St. Ives conflict. With the three realms drawing closer together, they form a powerful voting bloc within the reformed [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague2],Star League]]. Nonetheless, canny mercenary companies will likely be able to find those in need of help with off-the-books contracts, as garrison commanders in all three signatory states scramble for last-minute territory and prestige.\r\n\n\n\nST. IVES FALLS TO [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLiaoCCAF],CCAF]]!\r\n\n\n After months of brutal fighting, forces of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],Capellan Confederation]] Armed Forces and their allies reached the capital city of Tian-tan. Although Duchess Candace Liao was able to escape the planet before being captured, most observers agree that the Capellan victory here should quickly spell the end of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]] as a viable fighting force.\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for more news on the Chaos March.",

						"Details": "MORE ASSAULTS ON ACAMAR, GENOA AND ARBORIS\r\n\n\nIn the shadow of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],Capellan Confederation]]'s invasion of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]], waves of mercenaries are moving on the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreChaosMarch],Chaos March]] worlds of Acamar, Genoa and Arboris.\r\n\n\nSeveral large mercenary formations, obstensibly hired by the Acamar Merchants Freedom Guild (AMFG), have landed on that embattled planet. The size of the invading mercenaries appear larger than what many believed the AMFG were able to hire, leading to speculation that there are far more powerful backers behind the merchants.  Awaiting the invasion are mercenaries hired by the pro-[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHouseLiao],Liao]] nobility; identified mercenary groups include the Legion of Truth, Connor's Ransackers, and Kasparov's Knights.\r\n\n\nIn a well-timed move, another large contingent of mercenaries are heading to the planet Genoa.  Combat on that planet, wracked by infighting among various corporate CEOs, has been dominated by infantry fighting in tunnels beneath the planet's surface.  The arrival of these Battlemech-equipped mercenaries will undoubtedly change the dimensions of the conflict on Genoa.\r\n\n\nMeanwhile, on the world of Arboris, FedCom-hired mercenaries the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBKL],Black Knight Legion]] are enroute to support the Arboris [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSMM],SMM]] in that world's three-sided conflict.  The Arboris SMM are facing off against Liao's invading [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreIsharaGren],Ishara Grenadiers]], while the Grenadiers harass the civilian population, hoping to cow the defiant Arborean Freedom Farmer's Army into accepting Capellan rule.  The Farmers however view both Great House units as foreign occupiers.\r\n\n\nContracts are posted in the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],MRBC]] Database for each conflict.",
