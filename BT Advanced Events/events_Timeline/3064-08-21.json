Trade route disruption and abandoned garrisons from critical worlds have all led pirates to raid the weakened and distracted [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGreatHouses],Great Houses]] and Periphery States.  From the slave-pits of The Rack and Pain to the pirate holds of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Tortuga],Tortuga Dominions]], MercNews will highlight these hotspots of pirate activity and the dominant pirate bands that plague those regions.  Contracts to defend against or participate in raids are available via the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],MRBC]] Database.\r\n\n\n<b>MRBC OPEN PIRACY CONTRACTS:</b> Althea's Choice, Campoleone, Ferris(OA), Valasha, Vixen, Verdigreis.\r\n\n\n<b>MRBC DARK CASTE ACTIVITY:</b> Gateway, Thorn",

By 3064 only a single planet inside the cluster was known to be habitable, and was ruled over by the bandit king \"Bloody\" James Kaiten.\r\n\n\nKaiten maintained control of the planet until the arrival of Paula Trevaline, the infamous Lady Death, and her [[DM.Factions[faction_DeathsConsorts],Death's Consorts]].  Trevaline battled Kaiten for control of Haven, and Kaiten fought hard, finally dying \"kicking, thrashing and finally choking on his own tongue\" at the hands of Lady Death.  Now Dame of Haven, Trevaline and her Death's Consorts created a small 'Mech factory in the Cluster, which allowed the pirates to produce a light 'Mech for the first time, the Brigand.  Bouyed by the success of the Brigand, thousands of recruits and dozens of pirate bands have descended on the Haven to join Lady Death, making Death's Consorts the dominant criminal group in the region.",
