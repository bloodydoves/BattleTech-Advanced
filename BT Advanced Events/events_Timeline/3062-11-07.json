Early reports indicate that elements of the Alshain Avengers staged an assault on Ghost Bear forces in the system, although details are sketchy at best and the current status of the Avengers regiments and their destroyer, the <i>Dragon's Last Tear</i>, is unknown. The Alshain Avengers are a [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] unit formed from the remnants of the Alshain Regulars decimated during the Clan Invasion, but it is unknown whether the attack on Alshain was a rogue action or a sanctioned [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] mission.",
