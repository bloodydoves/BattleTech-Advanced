Niops VII has also become a favored destination for astronomers throughout the rest of the Periphery and Inner Sphere.  Royalty agreements on the sold data have since permitted the Association to buy a third 'Mech battalion, obstensibly to deter Marian adventurism, as well as engaging mercenary support.  The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBlackHeartRoses],Black Heart Roses]], fresh from their garrison contract on Great X, have finalized a new contract with the Niopians for garrison and cadre duties.",
