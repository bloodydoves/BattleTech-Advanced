After quick victories on Wismar, Stettin, and Novgorod, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMagonScott],Khan Magon Scott's]] forces have proceeded onto more important objectives. However, the early victories over the League's forces may not be a good indicator for future success, as each planet the Clans assault appear to be heavily defended by full [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRDF],Regional Defense Forces]]. While it is too early to declare a victor in the Scorpion's [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHanseaticCrusade],Hanseatic Crusade]], it does appear that the League is putting up a valiant fight against the invading forces.",

On Bruges, pollution from the accidental destruction of several chemical processing plants caused an accidental release of nerve agents, killing tens of thousands of civilians. While [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRDF],RDF]] 8 quickly surrendered in order to aid the civilians (an honorable surrender which was accepted by the Scorpion saKhan leading the assault), the casualties continue to mount. Meanwhile, the Scorpions on Kampen are facing a pyrrhic victory as [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRDF],RDF]] 7 fights tooth and nail for every inch of ground. Finally, on Köningsberg the Scorpions are managing to overcome [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRDF],RDF]] 2, though the task is taking much longer than anticipated due to the RDF's dug-in positions.",
