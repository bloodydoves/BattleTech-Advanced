Although still recovering from the chemical attack on Tsamma, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreTancredSandoval],Baron Tancred Sandoval]] returned to Robinson to face the bitter shell that had been his father. Tancred reportedly asked that he might shoulder his fathers' burdens, to which the old Duke replied \"Take them all, I've done my part.\" Baron Tancred was thus officially avowed Minister of the Draconis March on 7 October.",

Reportedly winning [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTrialPoss],Trial]] after [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTrialPoss],Trial]] on the ground, only a successful [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanSnowRaven],Snow Raven]] naval blockage was able to starve the invading force of the resources needed to maintain their invasion.
