Even before Victor’s call to arms against Katrina, brutal fighting was commonplace on the streets of notable planets such as [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSolaris7], Solaris VII]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKathil], Kathil]]. Now, with the campaign to unseat [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katrina]] in full swing, once-allied units have turned against each other as the conflict of brother versus sister is played out on countless battlefields across the Inner Sphere.   Commanders with personal issues that may prevent uncompromised completion of a current contract should contact the MRBC on Outreach at once for mediation with their employers.\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",

The Transpax Corporation of Halloran V has instituted corporate security measures in the face of what corporate spokespeople claim to be wanton piracy and banditry by local militia commanders. Details are unclear, but it has been confirmed that Transpax is seeking to contract mercenary units for short-term defense for their mining operations as well as some of Transpax's coastal holdings.\r\n\n\nCIVIL WAR ESCALATES ON NANKING\r\n\n\nA [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreChaosMarch],Chaos March]] world on the brink of conflict long before the start of the Fedcom Civil War, the attempt to seize the world by the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLoyalist],Loyalist]] Nanking [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSMM],Sarna March Militia]] in November 3062 was foiled by the previously neutral [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFedcomCorps],First Federated Commonwealth Regiment]].  Now after months of low-intensity conflict, the First FedCom have had enough and called in the Capellan March's [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKestrelGren],First Kestrel Grenadiers]] from Zurich to crush the Nanking SMM.  While the Grenadiers are still en-route to the planet, Loyalist commanders have called for mercenaries to support the Nanking militia.",
