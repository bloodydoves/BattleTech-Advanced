		"Details": "MERCNEWS PIRACY SPOTLIGHT: PIRATES OF THE TORTUGAN DOMINIONS:\r\n\n\nAlmost uniquely, Tortuga Prime had no previous settlements or civilization prior to becoming a pirate hold, instead being settled by [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDavionAFFS],AFFS]] deserters specifically as a base to raid the [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],Federated Suns]] and [[DM.Factions[faction_TaurianConcordat],Taurian Concordat]].  After decades of success, the pirates expand their holdings to five other worlds in search of resources, becoming the modern [[DM.Factions[faction_Tortuga],Tortuga Dominions]].\r\n\n\nIn the four centuries since the founding of the Tortuga Dominions, a succession of pirate bands held primacy in the region, the most notable being [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLadyDeath3062],\"Lady Death\" Paula Trevaline]] until her incarceration in the 3040s.  In the modern era however, ex-mercenaries Fuschida's Fusiliers gained control in the 3050s after breaking contract with the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFedCom],Federated Commonwealth]].  The now renamed [[DM.Factions[faction_TortugaFusiliers],Tortuga Fusiliers]] have expanded their infantry and aerospace forces and continue to not only raid Federated and Taurian worlds, but also raid as far afield as the [[DM.Factions[faction_Outworld],Outworlds Alliance]] and the [[DM.Factions[faction_MagistracyOfCanopus],Magistry of Canopus]] in the Periphery.  The Fusiliers have re-established ties with the newly freed Lady Death, but have discouraged all attempts at absorption or merger, making their point by destroying up to two companies of Fusiliers as they attempted to defect to Lady Death in the Pirate's Haven Cluster.",
