The Black Warriors remain on duty in the Federation as the sole military force of the nation.\r\n\n\nThis is the official story however - one still maintained by the Federation.  Decades of rumours coalesced into verifiable reports from the [[DM.Factions[faction_EridaniLightHorse],Eridani Light Horse]] that the Black Warriors had descended into piracy, and the Federation was actually a Bandit Kingdom underneath the veneer of respectability.  In recent times internal strife, desertion, failed military campaigns, and even active operations by the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSteinerLAAF],LAAF]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFWLM],FWLM]] against the Federation have greatly weakened the Black Warriors, however the Warriors continue to survive and pose a menace to the Federation's neighbours.",
