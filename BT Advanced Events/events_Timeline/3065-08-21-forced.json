When it became clear that they would not hold the capital, the Council of Merchants displayed the depths of their treachery, detonating a nuclear booby trap, leveling much the capital city and annihilating tens of thousands of lives, civilians and soldiers alike. Shocked, Captain-Marshal Rudolf Schmidt ordered his remaining troops to cease hostilities immediately as he hoped to save what remained of his people. Khan Magon Scott of the Goliath Scorpions accepted the Captain-Marshal's surrender though Regional Defense Force 3 refused to stand down and was summarily executed at the hands of the Scorpions (who flew into a frenzy at the senseless destruction wrought by the merchants).",
