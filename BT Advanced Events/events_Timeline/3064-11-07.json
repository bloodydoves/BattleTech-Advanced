Seeking to rectify that situation, Steiner dispatched elements of the Eleventh Arcturan Guard and the entirety of the Royal New Capetown Training Battalion to retake the planet. Expecting to face only a skeleton guard of the Thirty-Ninth Avalon Hussars, the overconfident New Capetowners were quickly overrun by a surprise force consisting of nearly a third of the Seventh Crucis Lancers RCT. Old oxen plow straight, as the ancient Terran adage goes, and the Eleventh Arcturan took a more careful approach to their landing, successfully evading the Avalon Hussars vanguards sent to intercept them. Once able to move on the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCoventryMW],Coventry Metal Works]] complex, the Guards faced the Lancers in a ten-day battle that cost both sides dearly, before ultimately attempting to withdraw. Seizing the chance, the remaining Lancers pounced, overrunning the Guards before they were able to evacuate. Victor's forces held Coventry but paid a heavy toll to do so.\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",
