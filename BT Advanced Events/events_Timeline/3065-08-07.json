Nearly three complete regiments of rebels faced off against the remnants of the Fifteenth Lyran Guard RCT and the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGrayDeath],Gray Death Legion]]. Although the Legion managed to single-handedly hold off two entire regiments, they paid a steep price to do so. Commander Lori Kalmar-Carlyle, wife to the late legend [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGraysonCarlyle],Grayson Death Carlyle]], was killed by Skye units, and the Legion itself was reduced to barely a company of functioning BattleMechs. Effectively destroyed, the survivors have reportedly been absorbed by the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreDSPF],Defiance Self-Protection Force]].",

Rumors had long circulated regarding the nature of his relationship with the late Omiko Kurita, and sources close to Steiner-Davion have confirmed that the prince is \"quite distraught\" by the loss of his beloved. Whether Victor's continued absence from the front lines will have any impact on his supporters' ability to prosecute the war on his behalf remains to be seen.",
