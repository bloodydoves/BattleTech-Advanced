Except for those indicted for war crimes and serious offenses, the two leaders have declared a general amnesty for all those who fought in the Civil War, and a release of all POWs.  Further, each have agreed to reassign major military units and Jumpships back to their original nations.\n\n\nWhile the rebuilding continues, dozens of shattered military units have been deactivated with their survivors reassigned to weakened units to shore up the border defence of these realms, in particular the Lyran border with Clan [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanJadeFalcon],Jade Falcon]].",

While the [[DM.Factions[faction_Kurita],Draconis Combine]] and [[DM.Factions[faction_Rasalhague],Freee Rasalhauge Republic]] have fortified their Clan borders for years, the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLyranAlliance],Lyran Alliance]]'s weakened military state has led to fears of yet another [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanJadeFalcon],Jade Falcon]] drive, this time towards Terra.  As such, Comstar, the Arch-Duke [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMorganKell2],Morgan Kell]] and the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSteinerLAAF],LAAF]]'s new Commanding General Adam Steiner have hired a large number of mercenary groups to reinforce the Lyran-Jade Falcon border.  A number of mercenary teams are already en-route or settling into their new stations, including Brion's Legion, the Grave Walkers, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBSI],Blue Star Irregulars]], [[DM.Factions[faction_SnordsIrregulars],Snord's Irregulars]], the [[DM.Factions[faction_Dioscuri],Dioscuri]], [[DM.Factions[faction_RubinskysLightHorse],Rubinsky's Light Horse]] and the One Eyed Jacks.",
