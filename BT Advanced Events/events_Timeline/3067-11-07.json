The Conference's objective is two-fold; to determine the response of the Star League against the Clan threat and on any inter-House conflict, and to elect a new First Lord of the Star League for another three year term.  Outgoing First Lord Christian Månsdottir is already on Tharkad, as are delegations from provisional members the [[DM.Factions[faction_TaurianConcordat],Taurian Concordat]] and the [[DM.Factions[faction_WordOfBlake],Word of Blake]] whom are seeking permanent memberhip in the League.  Notable absentees are the Chancellor [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSunTzuLiao],Liao]] and Magistrix Naomi Centralla.  Instead, Chancellor Liao sent a recorded message via courier, denouncing the Star League as nothing more than a \"hollow alliance of convenience that had already outlasted its usefulness.\"",
