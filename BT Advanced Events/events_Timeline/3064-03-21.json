Pro-[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katrina]] Loyalist and Pro-[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreVictorSD],Victor]] Allied forces are fighting from from Kathil to Tsamma, and from Dalkeith to Giasaur, with each side attempting to gain or hold the world's resources and strategic position for their champions.\r\n\n\nMercenary units, such as the famed [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKellHounds3062],Kell Hounds]] and the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGrayDeath2],Gray Death Legion]], have also declared for one side or the other.  The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],MRBC]] reminds all registered units to take great caution in selecting sensitive contracts during this conflict; all commands with personal issues that may prevent uncompromised completion of a current contract should contact the MRBC for mediation and adjudication.",
