The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFreeSkye],Skye separatists]] are no doubt counting on the distraction of the FedCom Civil War to divide the Loyalists' attention and allow them to consolidate their control of Skye and the recently conquered military hub of Freedom. Reliable intelligence from the region is spotty, but several reports have surfaced of military actions around the essential factory world of Hesperus II. Any [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFreeSkye],Free Skye]] units attempting a takeover of the factory would be facing the newly deployed [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGrayDeath],Gray Death Legion]], the Fifteenth and Thirty-sixth Lyran Guards forming the planetary garrison, and the corporate military [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreDSPF],Defiance Self-Protection Force]].",
