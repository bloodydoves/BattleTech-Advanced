Endo-Carbide was developed accidentally and was originally written off as a mistake since instead of lightening the structure it was denser and harder than normal structure. However, it was discovered that Endo-Carbide was significantly more durable than normal structure, at the cost of extra bulk in each component of the mech. The trade-off was deemed worthwhile and the structure was put into production.",
