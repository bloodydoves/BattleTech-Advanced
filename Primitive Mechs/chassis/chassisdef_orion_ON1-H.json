    "Details": "The ON1-H was the primitive prototype of the Orion that was eventually accepted for mass production in 2456. While slower than the first iterations, with a top speed of only 54 km/h, due to the inclusion of a smaller engine, the additional weight saved allowed the designers to mount far more firepower. A newly developed Class-10 Prototype Autocannon was installed and two tons of ammo in place of the AC/5. This was backed up by two 5-tube Long-Range Missile launchers with one ton of reloads for striking enemies at range and a SRM-4 missile launcher and a ton of ammunition for close-in defense. It was also heavily protected by 21 tons of armor. A minimal amount of heatsinks, however, could cause build-up of heat within crippling levels.",
